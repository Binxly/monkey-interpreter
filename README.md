# Monkey Interpreter

This project is an implementation of an interpreter for the Monkey programming language. The goal is to learn about the inner workings of interpreters and gain hands-on experience by building one from scratch using Go.

## Getting Started

To run the interpreter, ensure that you have Go installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the REPL, and you can begin entering Monkey code. The interpreter will parse and evaluate the code, providing the results in the REPL.

## Why Go?

- Closely maps to C (or other lower level languages)
- Readable and easy to understand
- Built-in tooling
- Fast B)

## Acknowledgements

This project follows the concepts taught in the book “[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com)” by Thorsten Ball.
